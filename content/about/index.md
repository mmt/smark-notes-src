Welcome!  My name is Mark Tobenkin, I'm a software engineer specializing
in control and esitmation systems.  This webpage is just a collection
of technical content I've found interesting and would like to hang on to.

A number of the pages are expository writing on math related to motion
estimation and navigation.  None of the results are new by any stretch
of the imagination, but sometimes they have a derivation that suits
my personal tastes (e.g. I find power series term matching really unsatisfying).

It's probably too much to ask, but if you do find an error, please [file an issue](https://github.com/mmt/smark-notes-src/issues)
over an the "source code" repository for this blog.  If my writing is unclear, or there are other results that seems worth mentioning I'm open to constructive comments over there as well.

Hope you find something interesting to read here.

Happy Hacking,

sMark
